      <p><b>I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamoto">Kumamoto Japan</a></b> and have lived in the California Bay Area for more than 10 years. I began teaching Japanese lessons in 2017 and I love what I do!</p>
      <p><b>I have many passions:</b> I love languages, reading, music, dance, animals, art, traveling, and all the beautiful things in the world! Especially "Tabemono" (<small>Japanese word for food</small>).</p>
