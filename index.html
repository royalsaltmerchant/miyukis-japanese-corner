      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p><b>I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamoto">Kumamoto Japan</a></b> and have lived in the California Bay Area for more than 10 years. I began teaching Japanese lessons in 2017 and I love what I do!</p>
      <p><b>I have many passions:</b> I love languages, reading, music, dance, animals, art, traveling, and all the beautiful things in the world! Especially "Tabemono" (<small>Japanese word for food</small>).</p>

      <h3>Private / Small Group Lessons</h3>
      <p><b>I teach all levels and all ages.</b> We can meet online or in-person (or a combination of both is ok!).</p>
      <p>I have many Japanese text books and materials including Manga/Anime to use, but all it's up to you! I can train you for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test">JLPT</a>, conversation practice, translations, etc... A personalized lesson for each! Please let me know what you would like to focus on and what your goals are.</p>
